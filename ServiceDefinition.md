# BC Government Team Mobile Services Definition

## Service Description

### Summary

The BC Government **Team Mobile Services** support native mobile application development through:

- Maintaining best practices, starter kit, deployment process; and
- Development and maintenance of a Mobile Signing Service; and
- Administration of 3rd-party services such as Google Play and Apple iTunes Connect; and
- Aiding in design and architecture for Enterprise level applications.

This does **not** include access or support to the Enterprise App Store commonly referred to as AirWatch. For this please contact the MDMS team.

### Features & Functions

Users of this service gain access to the following four services:

#### Mobile Signing

This service allows teams to sign their **iOS** applications with our Enterprise or iTunes Store production keys.

When using this service for **Android** it generates and retains the unique signing key for your application. This method will ensure the key is backed-up to prevent loss or corruption which may result in the inability to further update your application on Google Play.

 Once signed the team's application manager can distribute the application as they wish.

#### Public Stores

We have administrative and agent access to both the iTunes App Store and Google Play Store. We can invite developers as needed and grant the ability to for BC Government employees to be application managers for their team; this allows upload, distribution, and monitoring of metrics for your specific application.

Public stores can also be used for beta distribution.

#### Starter Kit

Resources to explain mobile development within the BC Government. This includes guides to the different tools, workflow, process, and for iOS automated code quality rules; for Android there are recommended best practices.

#### Community

We encourage a vibrant community of mobile focused developer through the `#gomobile` channel in [RocketChat](https://reggie.pathfinder.gov.bc.ca/?intention=LOGIN#error=login_required). Use your GitHub ID or IDIR to sign-up and join.
