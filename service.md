### Features & Functions

Users of this service gain access to the following four services.

#### Mobile Signing

This service allows developers to sigh their iOS applications with our Enterprise or iTunes Store production keys. Onces signed the application manager can distribute the application as they wish.

When using this service for Android we retains the signing key and ensure its backed up to prevent loss or corruption which would result in the inability to further update your application on Google Play.

#### Public Stores

We have administrative and agent access to both the iTunes App Store and Google Play Store. We can invite developers as needed and grant the ability to for BC Government employees to be application managers for their team; this allows upload, distribution, and monitoring of metrics.
